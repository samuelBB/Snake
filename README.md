# Snake
A Java Implementation of Classic Snake - A Recreational Project

Features:
- Splash Screen (with animation)
- Rotating Fruit
- Pausing (Work in Progress)
- Play Again (or Exit)

To play, compile the project to a .jar; Main is in SnakeGame.java (the main project file).

The game engine uses a fixed time-step; to adjust the difficulty, set the game-speed manually in the code.
Also possible to randomly color the snake by making some simple manual adjustments in the code.

See SnakeGame.java for features to add and fixes to be made.
