# Snake
A Java Implementation of Classic Snake
- A Recreational Project

Features:

	1) Splash Screen (with animation)

	2) Rotating Fruit

	3) Pausing (Work in Progress)

To play, compile the project to a .jar; Main is in SnakeGame.java (the main project file).

The game engine uses a fixed time-step; to adjust the difficulty, set the game-speed manually in the code.
Also possible to randomly color the snake by making some simple manual adjustments in the code.
